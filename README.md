# omicsMIC: a Comprehensive Benchmarking Platform for Robust Comparison of Imputation Methods in Mass Spectrometry-based Omics Data

**<font size='5'> omicsMIC </font>** is an interactive web-based platform that provides researchers with a versatile framework to simulate and evaluate the performance of 28 diverse imputation methods. omicsMIC offers a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity in biological data and the unique attributes of each dataset. It can empower researchers to make data-driven decisions in imputation method selection based on real-time visualizations of the outcomes associated with different imputation strategies. 

## How to Use omicsMIC

### Run it locally
omicsMIC can also be run on a local computer. Download the archive named **omicsMIC** from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10016741](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10016741), extract it locally, and then double-click the <img src="Run_omicsMIC.png" align="center" width="120" height="30" /> file without installing anything.

### Access via Our Cloud Server
Alternatively, you can directly access omicsMIC via the cloud:
